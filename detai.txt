(*) 3.1. Capstone Project name: 
English:  Admission Consulting Platform for Private High Schools in Ho Chi Minh City 
Vietnamese: Nền tảng tư vấn tuyển sinh vào Trường Trung Học Phổ Thông Tư Thục tại TPHCM
Abbreviation: EduBridgeHCM
Context: 
The transition from secondary school to high school in Ho Chi Minh City is one of the most competitive and stressful admission processes for pupils and parents. Each year, more than 76,000  pupils participate in the Grade-10 entrance examination, yet the information environment remains highly fragmented: 
Information scattering & inconsistency: Details about schools, admission scores, historical benchmarks, consultation channels, and specialized programs are spread across social networks, unofficial forums, and school announcements, causing confusion for parents.
Lack of personalized counseling: Pupils often choose schools without data-backed guidance. Many parents rely on subjective opinions instead of systematic analysis of academic performance, historical cut-off scores, or capability forecasting.
Manual advisory processes: Current career/orientation counseling activities happen through offline events, phone calls, or message groups, making it difficult to track, manage, or evaluate the quality of consultation.
Limited AI adoption: While AI can analyze learning data, predict admission probability, and recommend suitable schools, there is no unified system applying these technologies to Grade-10 admissions in HCM City.
Given these challenges, the project “Admission Consulting Platform for Private High Schools in Ho Chi Minh City” is proposed as a centralized digital platform that:
Connects parents, pupils, schools, and counselors on one unified system.
Uses AI models to predict admission probabilities, recommend appropriate schools, and analyze each student’s profile.
Standardizes and digitizes the admission consulting workflow from registration → counseling → tracking → evaluation.
Provides verified school information to avoid misinformation circulating on social networks.
Supports schools in managing recruitment sessions, receiving consultation requests, and interacting with parents.
This system contributes to enhancing transparency, improving the quality of admission support, and reducing the burden on both families and educational institutions. 
Proposed Solutions
To address the above issues, the EduBridgeHCM platform introduces a multi-component digital ecosystem:
• AI-Driven Counseling Engine
Problem: Students lack personalized, data-based guidance.
Solution:
Use AI models to analyze students’ academic performance, exam preparation history, and previous cut-off scores.
Predict the probability of acceptance into each school.
Recommend Top 5 suitable schools based on capability, location, tuition budget, and study interests.
• Verified Admission Information Hub
Problem: Admission information online is inconsistent and unverified.
Solution:
A centralized database where schools submit official data: programs, requirements, cut-off scores, quotas, and tuition.
Admin verifies and approves all content before publication.
• Consultation Management System
Problem: Consultation activities lack structure and tracking.
Solution:
Students/parents can book online counseling sessions with schools or certified counselors.
Each session has logs, feedback, and assigned counselors.
A history of counseling interactions is stored for further recommendations.
• Multi-platform System Architecture
Web Portal for Admin & Schools:Manages data, requests, counseling sessions, and analysis dashboards.
Mobile App for Students & Parents:Allows registering for counseling, viewing recommendations, receiving notifications, and tracking admission readiness.
• Analytics & Insights Dashboard
For schools: Shows student demand, historical trends, and consultation statistics.
For parents: Provides performance analytics, benchmarking, and readiness indicators.
